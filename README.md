# Springboard Data Science Career Track Capstone_2

The CIFAR10.ipynb notebook is an image classification of the CIFAR-10 image data. 

Techniques used include baseline modeling and convolutional neural network modeling using Keras wrapped Tensorflow. An AWS p2.xlarge instance with a GPU was used for training these models.

Also included are the final report and slide deck as required by the Springboard project guidelines.
